    <p class="blockquote">For a lot of us who take a look at our business while also wearing the consumer’s hat, it is obvious that mobile is killing it. Native apps - whether on iOS, Android, or any other platforms seem to be dominating user engagement metrics. Heck, we spend more time on apps when using mobile than opening a browser and explore content. Then, is it not decided that the web on mobile is on it’s path to a slow death? If it is the case, why should we even care about browsing our websites on mobile? Is it only a marginal use case, and only in cases where we don’t have a mobile app does it become a necessity? I’d urge you to weigh in on the following argument and reconsider your position on mobile web.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p class="blockquote">Some stats to start off:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p class="blockquote"><a href="https://twitter.com/googlechrome/status/722838421228523520" target="blank">Google says </a>Chrome has 1 Billion active users monthly on mobile.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p class="blockquote">It means a Billion people out there take pains to open up their mobile browser at least once a month to go check out a website! Did I hear “Not bad”? Read on.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p class="blockquote">Comscore in its <a href="https://www.comscore.com/layout/set/popup/content/download/36073/1978401/version/1/file/2016_US_Mobile_App_Report.pdf">latest US Mobile App Report</a> says the average American doesn’t download more than 2 Apps a month.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p class="blockquote">But there is a catch. Nearly half of smartphone users don’t download any app in a month. Are we looking at an app fatigue?
</p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p class="blockquote">Another worrying set of stats from the same Comscore report - Smartphone users spend 45% of their app time on their #1 most used app, and 90% of their time on their top Seven apps. Ironically, the top Seven most used Apps on Smartphone are owned by Facebook and Google.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p class="blockquote">This could potentially mean people spend most of their time on these social apps and devote little time for our apps. Ones that cost us a bomb to build, and more than a bomb to market and get installs.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p class="blockquote">Enough stats. Do me a favor by pondering over one question.
</p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p class="blockquote">Is it worth going the mobile app route?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p class="blockquote">Consider this. Everyone thought growth in mobile traffic, engagement, etc meant the death of web. On the contrary, mobile seems to be a closed club with fewer apps enjoying the majority of user’s time leaving little room for our business apps.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p class="blockquote">I believe mobile web has a great future, probably better one than mobile apps, and investing in it should help your business in higher engagement at lower costs.
</p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p class="blockquote">If you have had any experience either with mobile apps or with mobile web, better still any stats comparing the two, please share them.</p>
