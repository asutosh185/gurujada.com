<p class="blockquote"><span class="intro">Introduction</span>(skip this section if you know what meta tags are and why we use them):
If you ever cared to see the source of a web page, (it’s quite simple if you haven’t before, just do Ctrl + U) you see a host of meta tags and html markup that is used. While they are used by many engines, search engines happen to be the primary consumers (at least that’s the intention) of these meta tags and html markup. Examples include the Title, Meta Description, H1 etc. To know what these are you must first understand that Search Engines are bots, as in computing programs written to crawl the web and rank websites, and they can’t read websites the way humans do. So they need to be fed with additional markup and meta information for them to better understand our web page. A web page that is well understood ranks better.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p class="blockquote">Ever since SEO as a practice existed, careful use of meta tags and other html markup has been an important part of the SEO mix. Over time, search engines have gotten smarter, SEO practice itself emerged and people no longer look at them in the same way. When you look around, there isn’t enough written on what is the gold standard on meta tags and html markup that is both reliable and recent enough for you to take it seriously and apply it to your website. When we wanted to launch our own website recently, we had to struggle through numerous resources to make sense of this landscape. I wouldn’t dare say we understood it to perfection, but we made a start and we wanted to share what we learned in the process with everyone. This post is something that I wanted badly when I started. Hope it is of use to you.</p>

Most common are the script based attacks that inject a malicious piece of javascript into your website as it loads on a client and do all bad things.

Any other script will result in the browser throwing an error and protect your visitor.</p>

          <p class="blockquote">Enter SEO, and you know why Title tag matters. The Title tag tells search bots what your webpage is about. In fact it is the Title tag that people see in big bold blue font when your page shows up in search results (at least on Google). It has to be descriptive enough to entice a click from the searcher as well as be concise enough to show up completely. As of now the max length stands at 60 characters for Google.

Everything I covered for the Title tag apply here too, but importantly the description tag, as the name suggests, allows you to be descriptive about your page’s content.

        <p class="blockquote can">One of the basic advice dished out in SEO is to avoid duplicate content. But what do you do when you have to have duplicate content? Say you sell socks across the US and in each city the price is different. You end up having a page for each city that has all the content same as each other except for the price - the socks photos, titles, descriptions, etc. The Canonical tag saves you from being penalized by Search Engines. Simply use the tag and point the URL to the main product page so that Search Engines understand that your intent behind duplicating content isn’t to fool them or the visitor.</p>

        <p class="blockquote">Did you notice what Facebook does when you share a link along with your post? I generates a good looking preview of the page your link points to. How does Facebook do that? It uses Open Graph - a protocol that allows you to communicate with Facebook as to what it should use to generate the preview - the Title, short description, the image and the link. Use the following tags you can supply these attributes to Facebook and whenever someone shares your page the preview gets generated using what you supplied.</p>

What is a favicon doing here? Well, a favicon isn’t as unimportant as one may assume it to be. It is important for an odd reason, not necessarily an SEO specific one. When a bot scrapes your website and creates a profile for your business, it will more likely use your favicon as an alternative to your logo. So it pays to have one in the first place, and have it really stand out and communicate your brand.</p>
