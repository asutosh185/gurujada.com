  <p class="blockquote">Your website is your piece of real estate on the web. Carefully strategising this real estate so that visitors can easily navigate to what they are seeking will go a long way into having happy clients and ringing cash registers.  
  </p>
  <p class="blockquote">The significance of a well laid out home page is often undermined. It is assumed that visitors and customers will find their way around the website and little time and thought is put into making it easily steerable. So if you are wondering why all that inbound traffic is not converting into leads, check if your website holds good to these important pointers.</p>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <h2>1. Is the site NAVIGATION easy?</h2>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <p class="blockquote">Think about it. Why do retail giants meticulously arrange their wares in a storefront? Why do salesmen assist visitors while they make purchases. Because it costs them thousands of dollars for footfall and the retails cannot afford of not having an article handy when the client asks for it. Well, the same holds good for websites. While we can’t have salesmen assisting our visitors in this virtual medium, we can structure the layout of the webpage for effective navigation. And if the seeking is interesting and engaging for the visitors, they are likely to come back for more.

<div class="row">
  <p class="blockquote">This example from <a href="www.mrilq.com/"  target="_blank">MrilQ</a>, a natural beauty products company, designed by <a href="/">Gurujada</a> shows a host of different products and services with easy no-fuss navigation.</p>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <h2>2. Is it SHORT and sweet?</h2>
</div>
<div class="row"  >
  <p class="blockquote">Yes, Less is beautiful. </p>
  <p class="blockquote">Gone are the days when every page on the website used to have huge chunks of content dump. It was very inconvenient to even perceive what the company is selling. Today emphasis is given to lesser words, more white space and structured content.  These features enhance readability and are gentler on the eye. Every pixel is meticulously examined for its purpose and if not justified,  is trashed immediately.  </p>
  <p class="blockquote">Navigation tabs too are clearly named with logical links grouped together. Any other content which is not necessary to create a first impression is cleverly stashed into the footer as links.
</p>
</div>
<div class="row discoverRes">
      <img src="/images/blog/mint.png" class="img-responsive" alt="positioning">
</div>
<div class="row">
  <p class="blockquote">This example by <a href="https://www.mint.com/" target="_blank">Mint</a> depicts only a few navigation tabs for the casual visitor. A returning user is promptly redirected into the login section. </p>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <h2>3. Is the POSITIONING clear ?</h2>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <p class="blockquote">A precise positioning statement about "what you do" or about the problems you solve. If needed, a subtext can help in eloborating it.</p>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <p class="blockquote">This short yet effective, no-fuss wording should pique the attention of your user and prod him to know more about your offering. It should be written in such a way that the prospective buyer should immediately relate to it thinking “Yeah, this talks about my problem. Thats me! I need this solution”.</p>
</div>
<div class="row discoverRes">
      <img src="/images/blog/dropbox.png" class="img-responsive" alt="relevant description">
</div>
<div class="row">
  <p class="blockquote">This example from <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/business" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>, a file sharing company talks about just what the business does, albeit adding a personal touch, all within a few words. </p>
</div>
<div class="row">
      <h2>4. Is there a Call To Action?</h2>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <p class="blockquote">Don’t let visitors wonder what to do next. Guide them into taking action. A clear CTA (Call To Action) encourages visitors to act.  It tells them what to do if they are sold on the idea. 
It can either be a SIGN UP, or a BUY  or a READ MORE or a SHOP or a SUBSCRIBE or anything else. Everything that you ever bought online was a result of an effective CTA that convinced you to make that purchase. And since you don’t want your clients to miss this button, it should be screaming for attention - in color, font, size and shape. 
</p>
</div>
<div class="row discoverRes">
      <img src="/images/blog/call-to-action.jpeg" alt="relevant description" class="img-responsive">
</div>
<div class="row">
  <p class="blockquote">This example from <a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a>, the CTA is the brightest button around with all the other text and positioning written on white.  </p>
</div>
<div class="row">
      <h2>5. Are the BENEFITS stated?</h2>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <p class="blockquote text-center"><b><em>“ Features tell, benefits sell ”</em></b> a wise man once said. </p>
    <p class="blockquote">Benefits tell your visitors how your product or service can help them solve their problems and improve their lives.  It relates to them on an emotional level and answers the question “Whats in it for me?”
</p>
     <p class="blockquote">Your visitors will think - “Ok, your product has "one touch conference calling". So what? How will that help me?” Benefit would be - “easy navigation and quick communication”. Don’t go about bombarding your audience with a boring list of features. Features list is helpful only after your visitors are convinced that your product can benefit them immensely. Focus on how your product can help in making life easier for your visitors.</p>
</div>
<div class="row discoverRes">
    <img src="/images/blog/trello.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Navigation">
</div>
<div class="row">
  <p class="blockquote">In the above example, <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a>, a collaboration software, lists out its key benefit. And anyone working with teams can immediately relate to it. It shows your audience how their life will change for the better with your offering.</p>
</div>
<div class="row">
      <h2>6. Finally, how do you establish CREDIBILITY?</h2>
</div>
<div class="row">
 <p class="blockquote">People buy from businesses they like and trust. By showing how customers are appreciating your work, you can boost your credibility and trustworthiness. People like to emulate and when they see others just like themselves do business with you, they are likely to follow.
</p>
  <p class="blockquote">Trust indicators can be customer testimonials, success stories or media quotes. Even industry associations and likes on social media, anything that will show your visitors that you are real people and not some random robots. They are very powerful to help bring your visitors one step closer to becoming customers.</p>
</div>
<div class="row discoverRes">
  <img src="/images/blog/basecamp.png" alt="basecamp" class="img-responsive">
</div>
<div class="row">
   <p class="blockquote">This example from <a href="https://basecamp.com/" target="_blank">Basecamp</a>, explicitly  shows testimonials from clients on its home page. This reiterates the fact that such trust indicators are very powerful in bringing visitors a step closer to becoming customers.</p>
   <p class="blockquote">These important pointers pretty much sum up the homepage. The intention of this post is not to ask you, the quintessential entrepreneur, to start developing websites (you could do that too, albeit with a few trade offs). Instead, it is to equip you with the know how of a good, conversion oriented website. Knowing these simple strategies will enable you to participate in crafting a targeted website experience for your clients. Well, isn't that what we are all after?</p>
